# pid-component

The `pid-component` dynamically renders a component based on the value of the `value` property.
Depending on the value, it decides which component to render, what priority to give it, and what props to pass to it.
It also renders itself recursively for all its children when unfolded.
You can set the maximum depth of recursion with the `level-of-subcomponents` property.
By default, it is set to 1, which means that it will only render the first level of children, but not their children.
You can prohibit unfolding of the component by setting the `current-level-of-subcomponents` to the same value as the `level-of-subcomponents` property.

You can find the source code of the component [on GitHub](https://github.com/kit-data-manager/pid-component).
To import the component into your HTML page, use the following snippet:

```html
<head>
  <script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@kit-data-manager/pid-component"></script>
</head>
```

**Please notice that you must use the hyphenated version of an attribute when using the component directly in HTML (e.g. `currentLevelOfSubcomponents` -> `current-level-of-subcomponents`).
When using inside Stencil or with JSX/TSX syntax, you must use the camelCase version.**

## Default

<Canvas of={PIDComponentStories.Default} />

## Controls

Here you can play around with the component and see how it behaves.

## ORCiD in record

You can even use this component to render different kinds of components inside a single component.
Notice here that the ORCiDs are rendered with as a usual ORCiD component, the dates and urls are also nicely formatted and styled.

<Canvas of={PIDComponentStories.ORCIDInRecord} />

## Settings

Different components need different settings.
You can pass these settings to the component via the 'settings' property.
E.g., The ORCiD component enables you to decide whether you want to show the affilliation in the summary or not.
It also enables you to show the affilliation at a certain point of time.

For better performance, the pid-component stores fetched data in the IndexedDB.
To ensure that the data and representation are up-to-date, you can set a time-to-live (TTL) for each type.
The TTL is the time in milliseconds after which the data is considered outdated and will be fetched again.
In the example below, the TTL for the HandleType is set to 1 hour (3600000 ms) and for the ORCIDType to 1 day (86400000 ms).
This results in the following settings JSON that you have to provide in a stringified form:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "HandleType",
    "values": [
      {
        "name": "ttl",
        "value": 3600000
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "type": "ORCIDType",
    "values": [
      {
        "name": "ttl",
        "value": 86400000
      },
      {
        "name": "affiliationAt",
        "value": 949363200000
      },
      {
        "name": "showAffiliation",
        "value": true
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

This is an example where the settings above are passed to the component:

<Canvas of={PIDComponentStories.ORCIDInRecordWithSettings} />

## No subcomponents

You can also prohibit the unfolding of the component by setting the `current-level-of-subcomponents` to the same value as the `level-of-subcomponents` property.
Alternatively, simply set the attribute `hide-subcomponents`.

<Canvas of={PIDComponentStories.HandleWithoutSubcomponent} />

## Available types (for now)

The component can render the following types of components:

- PIDs (resolvable via [handle.net](handle.net))
- ORCiDs (resolvable via [orcid.org](orcid.org))
- URLs (starting with http:// or https://)
- Emails (separated by comma)
- Dates
- Everything else is rendered as a simple string (aka. fallback).

You can easily add a new type by simply implementing the abstract class `GenericIdentifierType` and adding it to the `Parser`.

### PID

<Canvas of={PIDComponentStories.Handle} />

### ORCiD

<Canvas of={PIDComponentStories.ORCID} />

### URL

<Canvas of={PIDComponentStories.URL} />

### E-Mail addresses

<Canvas of={PIDComponentStories.Email} />

You can also render multiple e-mail addresses separated by a comma.

<Canvas of={PIDComponentStories.CommaSeperatedMails} />

### Date

<Canvas of={PIDComponentStories.Date} />

### Fallback (string)

<Canvas of={PIDComponentStories.Fallback} />

## Adaptive Pagination

The component supports adaptive pagination, which automatically adjusts the number of items shown per page based on the available space. This ensures the data table is always fully visible without internal scrolling.

When you enable adaptive pagination:
- The component will calculate how many items can fit in the available space
- The pagination will automatically adjust when the container is resized
- The `amount-of-items` property becomes the initial value that can be unrestricted changed by the user
- The component will estimate row heights using the `estimated-row-height` property
- When a subcomponent is expanded, other items remain on the same page if space allows
- If space is limited, items will automatically reflow to the next page as needed
- The parent component size remains fixed, ensuring a consistent layout

Users can manually adjust the number of items per page using the pagination controls, even in adaptive mode. This gives users full control over the display while still benefiting from the automatic space optimization.

To enable adaptive pagination, set the `adaptive-pagination` attribute to `true`:

```html
<pid-component
  value="21.T11981/be908bd1-e049-4d35-975e-8e27d40117e6"
  adaptive-pagination="true"
  amount-of-items="10"
  estimated-row-height="40">
</pid-component>
```

This is particularly useful for responsive layouts where the available space may change based on screen size or user interactions, or when working with complex data that includes expandable subcomponents.

## Inside a text

You can also use the component in text.
It will be rendered in line while folded and will take up the whole width of the container when unfolded.

<Canvas of={PIDComponentStories.HandleInText} />

You can make the component even smaller by setting the `emphasize-component` attribute to `false`.

<Canvas of={PIDComponentStories.HandleInTextNotEmphasized} />

This is an example where the subcomponents are hidden and the component is not emphasized.

<Canvas of={PIDComponentStories.HandleWithoutSubcomponentInText} />

This is an example where an ORCiD is rendered in text.

<Canvas of={PIDComponentStories.ORCIDInText} />
